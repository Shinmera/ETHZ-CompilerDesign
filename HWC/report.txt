## Report for the Discussion on Teama
- Structure is clear and quite readable. The visitor pattern is used nicely and this helps the comprehension.
- Some of the parts are hacky because of a lack of time and a rush to the deadline.
- The TraverseInfo class seems to be superfluous and could have been left out.
- The code has a few bugs, such as the binary operators, which don't check the types properly.
- The code performed quite well overall despite the circumstances.
- No check for the return type conformance is done upon method overriding.
- There are detailed error messages, which is nice.
- Not a single comment, which is making it hard to read and understand.
