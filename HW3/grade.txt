Incomplete circular inheritance check, leading to infinite loops -2

Arrays are not handled at all... -3
    Not in the symbol table
    Not considered in subtype check
    No checks for indexing, array creation, ...
    There is one place where arrays are considered (assingments),
    but there they are handled wrongly (arrays should be invariant)

Missing type checks: -1
    New array
    Array indexing

NPE for return-nothing stmts -0.5

Bug in SemanticPopulatorAstVisitor: -1
	ast.type not set for method calls, leading to calls to results of calls
	interpreted as calls to "this"...
    Same for field accesses, leading to NPEs
    Same for "this" refs, leading to NPEs

Incomplete invalid start point check: params not checked -0.5

null type not in symbol table, leading to NPEs -1

Incorrect subtype check: -1
    Object class not handled correctly
    null not handled correctly

Buggy invalid-override check: methods sometimes not found in superclasses -0.5

Incorrect type check for < <= >= > ops -0.5

Missing type check for while condition -0.5

Incorrect type check for equality: left may be subtype of right or vice versa -0.5

Incorrect return stmt check: returns in if-else ignored -1
