Comments:

1) The builtInRead fails for some tests. I don't know what is wrong.

2) There is no implementation of a method that calculates the minimum number of required registers.
Instead you check if the left is instance of BinaryOp to decide whether to visit the left or the right first.

3) Division is incorrect. You didn't use cltd to extend the sign of %eax to %edx.
Your solution requires more registers since you don't store %eax and %edx in the stack, but this is fine if you calculate correctly the minimum number of required registers (which is missing here).
