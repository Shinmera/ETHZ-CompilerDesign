TESTING: 3/5
 - no HW2_team folder
 - you don't cover a lot of language features
 

Instead of continuing to list all the bugs that our tests exposed, I try to judge what is there and appears to work. I see that your grammar is incomplete, but handles some of the tricky parts. However, I have to wonder why you deviate so much from the grammer given in the Javali language specification. Implementing that grammar should not have been a lot of work.

Your JavaliAstVisitor is also incomplete, but again contains some of the important building blocks. With this in mind, I can give you 15 out of 30 points.
